Understanding that NEPA and the threat of litigation impose a sizable burden on agencies, this 
analysis shifts the question of burden away from scale and instead toward outcomes. Our study 
analyzed 387 NEPA cases filed at District Court and then appealed to a Circuit Courtin effect, 
the cases most burdened by NEPA litigationbetween 2013 and 2022. 
Our findings suggest that NEPA litigation at this level rarely changes environmental outcomes 
or protects environmental justice communities. Instead, judicial review of NEPA decisions largely 
serves as an advocacy tool for a small number of well-organized nonprofits to stall projects that 
do not align with their values.
The burden of NEPA litigation has increased while its impact on environmental outcomes  
has decreased.
Between 2013 and 2022, Circuit Courts heard approximately 39 NEPA appeals cases per year, a 
56% increase over the average annual rate from 2001 to 2015 .10 By contrast, the number of final 
environmental impact statements (FEISs) in the same time periods dropped. Between 2001 and 
2015, 210 FEISs were published on average per year in the EPA's EIS database , while 132 were pub -
lished between 2013 and 2022.11 While EISs represent a small share of environmental documents 
produced, they attracted the most litigation, comprising 42% of the challenges in our dataset. 
Thus, both the sheer number of legal challenges filed and the rate at which EISs faced challenges 
at the appellate level increased in the most recent decade.
Agencies won about 80% of the appeals from 2013 to 2022, 11% more per year than from 2001 to 
2004 , 8% more than from 2001 to 2008,  and 4% less than from 2009 to 2015 .12 The rate at which  
agencies reviews are upheld is high, meaning these environmental reviews are seldom changed 
as a result of litigation.
On average, 4.2 years elapsed between when an environmental review was published and 
a legal challenge at the appellate level was settled.
Under current procedure, challengers can contest NEPA-related decisions for up to six years 
following publication under the Administrative Procedures Act. Appeals, however, are not time-
bound in the same way. Still, 84% of appealed cases in the last decade were closed less than six 
years after the contested permit was published, and 39% were closed in less than three years. 
Length of time to resolution varied by project category (Table 1).
