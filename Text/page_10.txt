67% of these cases (Table 6), underscoring that NEPA litigation often originates from activism 
efforts advanced by a small number of NGOs. Collectively, this group of organizations won only 
23% of their cases, while adding about 3.7 years on average to the process of implementing proj -
ects on cases they lost.
