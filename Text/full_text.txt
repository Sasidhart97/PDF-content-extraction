UNDERSTANDING  
NEPA LITIGATIONA SYSTEMATIC REVIEW 
OF RECENT NEPA-RELATED 
APPELLATE COURT CASES
 ---------- NEW PAGE ----------

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Ongoing permitting reform debates in Washington, DC, have mostly orbited around the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). A procedural environmental regulatory umbrella law, NEPA 
creates significant and complex requirements for all major infrastructure projects and federal 
activities affecting the environment. 
Broadly, NEPA requires that federal agencies conduct environmental reviews of proposed activi -
ties and their potential effects. For complex projects, agencies can either prepare an environmen -
tal impact statement (EIS) or an environmental assessment (EA). Alternatively, simpler projects 
can be afforded a categorical exclusion (CE) which fast-tracks the review process. After permits 
are granted through these review mechanisms, they may be challenged in the judicial system. 
The courts then have the authority to reaffirm, bolster, or otherwise improve the project plan to 
prevent or limit environmental damage. Of course, lawsuits to challenge EISs, EAs, and CEs neces -
sarily extend project timelines. Particularly in the wake of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act (2021), the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), and the CHIPS and Science Act (2022), federal policy -
makers and policy advocates have drawn increased attention to the regulatory burden and delay 
imposed by this judicial review.
However, the NEPA litigation debate has suffered from a deficit of empirical evidence. Our analy -
sis helps fill this knowledge gap, documenting and sorting hundreds of NEPA litigation cases to 
assess trends, patterns, and impacts on various types of major infrastructure projects. 
Breakthrough Institute analysts, in collaboration with legal experts at Holland & Knight, com -
piled and analyzed 387 NEPA cases brought to the U.S. appellate court system over the 2013-2022 
period and categorized them by project type, environmental review, length of judicial review, 
federal agency, and plaintiff. Our results indicate that NEPA litigation overwhelmingly functions 
as a form of delay, as most cases take years before courts ultimately rule in favor of the defending 
federal agency.  
As Congress deliberates reforms to NEPA, it is essential that policymakers recognize the degree 
to which the legal status quo prioritizes procedure over outcomes. To enable more effective 
environmental review, reforms should minimize the potential for extended, unproductive legal 
battles while still promoting the fair assessment of environmental impacts.

Key findings:  
  Between 2013 and 2022, circuit courts heard approximately 39 NEPA appeals cases per year,  
a 56% increase over the rate from 2001 to 2015 .2
  Agencies won about 80% of the 2013-2022 appeals cases, 11% more per year than from 2001 
to 2004 , 8% more than from 2001 to 2008 , and 4% less than from 2009 to 2015 .3 The rate at 
which agencies reviews are upheld is high, meaning these environmental reviews are seldom 
changed as a result of litigation.
  On average, 4.2 years elapsed between publication of an environmental impact statement  
or environmental assessment and conclusion of the corresponding legal challenge at the 
appellate level. Of these appealed cases, 84% were closed less than six years after the contested 
permit was published, and 39% were closed in less than three.
  Among the challenges, 42% contested environmental impact statements, and 36% contested 
environmental assessments. Agencies won about 80% of challenges to both.
  NGOs instigated 72% of the total challenges. Of those, just 10 organizations initiated 35% and 
had a success rate of just 26%, merely 6% higher than the average for all types of plaintiffs.
  Only 2.8% of NEPA litigations pertained to agency assessment of environmental justice issues.
  Public lands management projects were the most common subject of litigation (37%), the 
greatest share of which (47%) challenged forest management projects. Just 10 groups filed 67% 
of the challenges to forest management projects and collectively won only 23% of those cases, 
adding 3.7 years on average to the process of implementing the 77% of projects on cases  
they lost.
  Energy projects were the second most common subject of litigation (29%). Litigation delayed 
fossil fuel and clean energy project implementation by 3.9 years on average, despite the fact 
that agencies won 71% of those challenges. NGOs filed 74% of energy cases, with just 10 organi -
zations responsible for 48% of challenges.

INTRODUCTION
President Richard Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) into law in 1970,  
institutionalizing environmental protection as a matter of national importance. The laws 
initial decree was simple: federal agencies must consider the environmental impacts of their 
decisions before taking action. In the decades following, agency responsibility ballooned. 
In 1981, the Council on Environmental Quality contended that an environmental impact  
statement (EIS) would take less than 12 months to complete. In 2022, it took about four years .4 
These lengthy review processes delay infrastructure projects of all varieties, including power 
lines and wildfire mitigation projects. 
In the wake of the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, members of Congress and 
President Biden have expressed concern that NEPA will slow the decarbonization process. 
Despite general consensus that NEPA needs to be reformed, Congress has struggled to reach  
consensus on significant reforms.
Of the many facets of permitting reform, NEPA litigation has become the most hotly contested 
and the least understood. Researchers have published only a handful of studies capable of 
informing evidence-based reform. Among those few, most narrowly assert that the burden of 
NEPA litigation is not large enough to merit reform. Ruple and Race , for example, claim that the 
burden is minimal because less than 1% of all federal civil litigation pertains to NEPA.5 Adelman 
and Glicksman  similarly assert the burden is small because only a small share of environmental 
review documents are litigated.6 While both illustrate that NEPA litigation is rare in the grand 
scheme of federal responsibility, they conflate aggregate burden with the scale of an agencys 
obligations.
Agencies definitively struggle to keep up with their NEPA-related obligations. A complex,  
quantitative study is not needed to identify that. Agency staff have made it clear since 1997 .7  
The U.S. Forest Service, the agency that shoulders the greatest NEPA burden, provides a prime 
example. By its own admission, excessive environmental reviews have prevented the Forest 
Service from effectively managing forests, at one point consuming almost 40% of the agencys 
budget .8 Such efforts are in no small part driven by fear of litigation. Forest managers habitually 
prepare more complex environmental reviews in hopes of avoiding legal challenges.9 
 ---------- NEW PAGE ----------

Understanding that NEPA and the threat of litigation impose a sizable burden on agencies, this 
analysis shifts the question of burden away from scale and instead toward outcomes. Our study 
analyzed 387 NEPA cases filed at District Court and then appealed to a Circuit Courtin effect, 
the cases most burdened by NEPA litigationbetween 2013 and 2022. 
Our findings suggest that NEPA litigation at this level rarely changes environmental outcomes 
or protects environmental justice communities. Instead, judicial review of NEPA decisions largely 
serves as an advocacy tool for a small number of well-organized nonprofits to stall projects that 
do not align with their values.
The burden of NEPA litigation has increased while its impact on environmental outcomes  
has decreased.
Between 2013 and 2022, Circuit Courts heard approximately 39 NEPA appeals cases per year, a 
56% increase over the average annual rate from 2001 to 2015 .10 By contrast, the number of final 
environmental impact statements (FEISs) in the same time periods dropped. Between 2001 and 
2015, 210 FEISs were published on average per year in the EPA's EIS database , while 132 were pub -
lished between 2013 and 2022.11 While EISs represent a small share of environmental documents 
produced, they attracted the most litigation, comprising 42% of the challenges in our dataset. 
Thus, both the sheer number of legal challenges filed and the rate at which EISs faced challenges 
at the appellate level increased in the most recent decade.
Agencies won about 80% of the appeals from 2013 to 2022, 11% more per year than from 2001 to 
2004 , 8% more than from 2001 to 2008,  and 4% less than from 2009 to 2015 .12 The rate at which  
agencies reviews are upheld is high, meaning these environmental reviews are seldom changed 
as a result of litigation.
On average, 4.2 years elapsed between when an environmental review was published and 
a legal challenge at the appellate level was settled.
Under current procedure, challengers can contest NEPA-related decisions for up to six years 
following publication under the Administrative Procedures Act. Appeals, however, are not time-
bound in the same way. Still, 84% of appealed cases in the last decade were closed less than six 
years after the contested permit was published, and 39% were closed in less than three years. 
Length of time to resolution varied by project category (Table 1).

Note:  This table includes data only from the 258 cases contesting EAs and EISs, as data on CEs and other reviews is rarely 
accessible. Some Records of Decision and Findings of No Significant Impact provided only the month and year of publication; 
we coded those cases using the first day of the given month.
Thus, the window for eligible challenges to environmental review could be shortened substan -
tially without meaningfully affecting environmental outcomes.   
Agencies fulfilled their responsibilities under NEPA with exceptional accuracy, regardless of  
the level of review required.
Table 2: Appeals and agency win-rates for all NEPA reviews by document type and total, 20132022.
Document type Number of cases % of total cases Agency win-rate
Categorical exclusion 19 4.9% 73.7%
Environmental assessment 139 35.8% 79.1%
Environmental impact statement 162 41.8% 79.6%
NA 67 17.5% 82.1%
Total 387 79.6%
Note:  NA refers to cases in which a NEPA review was not conducted, but plaintiffs argue one should be.
Overall, while there were slight differences in win-rates across document types, agencies prevailed 
in about 80% of challenges filed against both EAs and EISs (Table 2). This finding is remarkable 
because both the substance of and arguments brought against the two documents differ substan -
tially across agencies and project types. 
 ---------- NEW PAGE ----------

An EA assesses if a proposed project will impact the environment. An EIS is generally conducted 
once an EA has determined a project will impact the environment and evaluates how to min -
imize that impact. By virtue of their complexity, EISs create more opportunities for litigation. 
While challengers often argue that agencies erred in not elevating an EA to an EIS, theyre able 
to argue that an EIS did not consider any number of alternative actions. Still, agencies prevail 
in challenges to both EISs and EAs at the same rate, suggesting agency decision-making rarely 
needs oversight when it comes to NEPA compliance. 
Major national environmental NGOs instigated a disproportionate share of this litigation.
Consistent with trends observed in the previous decade , NGOs in 2013-2022 accounted for a 
sizable majority of NEPA-related appeals (72%), with state and local governments, individuals, 
companies, and other stakeholders filing far lower shares of appealed cases (Table 3).13 However, 
these nonprofit organizations lost appeals in 2013-2022 at a marginally higher rate than in  
previous periods, with a 13% increase in losses compared to 2001 to 2005  and a 5% increase  
compared to 2001 to 2015.14
Despite their expertise and concentrated staff capacity, NGOs werent substantially more success -
ful than other plaintiffs in their appeals. Plaintiffs won 16% of cases that did not involve NGOs, 
a 7% lower success rate than those that did. This finding diverges from an earlier analysis  that 
found environmental plaintiffs prevailed between 17% and 13% more often than other groups 
in Circuit Courts.15

Even the most well-resourced NGOs rarely won cases when challenging NEPA decisions.  
Just 10 NGOs initiated 35% of the total challenges (Table 4), and they had a success rate of just 
26%, merely 6% higher than the average success rate for all types of plaintiffs. Thats less  
than in prior decades , when prominent environmental groups won 35% of their appeals.16
Yet, these organizations pride themselves on being experts in environmental litigation.  
The Sierra Club advertises itself as having perfected the art of campaign litigation and  
lawyer-organizing.17 The Center for Biological Diversity claims that it melds  cutting-edge  
legal strategies with grassroots organizing .18 The Natural Resources Defense Council helped 
start the environmental legal movement  and maintains significant litigation activities today.19 
These and other groups make clear that their NEPA litigation is not solely utilized to improve 
environmental outcomes associated with infrastructure projects, but to obstruct and delay proj -
ects themselves, often for the purpose of preventing the project from ever moving forward at all.

Energy and infrastructure projects in particular are more likely to face cancellation if challenged 
under NEPA .20 While project cancellation is not the intent of the statute, litigation represents a 
creative and effective strategy to stop projects plaintiffs believe will do substantial harm. But 
these groups frequently contest projects that serve national policy objectives set by elected offi -
cials, calling the purpose and societal benefit of judicial review in its current form into question.

NEPA litigation has rarely focused on environmental justice.
Environmental nonprofits and decision-makers  alike have vocally highlighted the perceived 
threat NEPA reform would impose on marginalized communities.21 The Center for Biological 
Diversity even accused a member of Congress of  trying to silence communities of color and 
poor communities in places like Louisianas Cancer Alley, 22 after proposing a bill that would 
reduce the amount of time in which an environmental review can be challenged. However,  
a meager 2.8% of challenges in our 2013-2022 dataset related to environmental justice issues.  
In fact, NEPA has never played a large role  in protecting environmental justice communities  
at all.23 
In part, thats because agencies dont have clear statutory authority in that realm .24 Executive 
Orders (E.O. 12898 of February 11, 1994, and more recently E.O. 14096 of April 21, 2023) have 
encouraged agencies to incorporate environmental justice into the NEPA process, but cannot 
legally set enforceable standards.
And even if those parameters and responsibilities were precisely defined, NEPA would not  
provide an effective protection mechanism. NEPA is a technology-agnostic procedural law,  
made to evaluate and mitigate environmental impacts. The law is not designed to stop, replace, 
or relocate projects. Such considerations remain a matter of national policy that federal 
lawmakers are already working to address under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Justice40 
Initiative, and other laws. 
Forest management projects were the most common subject of litigation.
Despite public outcry over NEPAs impact on clean energy deployment, energy projects dont con -
stitute the largest share of legal challenges in this dataset. Instead, the majority (37%) of total 
NEPA challenges contested public lands management projects. 
The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management together manage the majority of  
federally owned land in the United States, about 437 million acres .25 A NEPA review is required 
whenever these agencies perform management activities, like removing dead trees or building 
roads. This highlights a key distinction between the requirements NEPA imposes on public lands 
management agencies and those that focus on building infrastructure. Where NEPA acts as a 
mechanism to regulate private industry activity when permitting mines or wind farms, it also 
governs how land management agencies execute their core, legislatively mandated responsibil -
ities. Thus, NEPA litigation poses a unique challenge for these agencies, allowing the public to 
contest the minutiae of their every decision.

In this dataset, forest management projects were most often the subject of appeals (Table 5), 
constituting 47% of land management cases and 17% of cases overall. Just 10 organizations filed 
67% of these cases (Table 6), underscoring that NEPA litigation often originates from activism 
efforts advanced by a small number of NGOs. Collectively, this group of organizations won only 
23% of their cases, while adding about 3.7 years on average to the process of implementing proj -
ects on cases they lost.

Within the forest management category, plaintiffs challenged timber harvest and fuel manage -
ment projects the most frequently (Table 7). Timber sales on public land have long generated 
controversy, both inside and outside the context of NEPA. While the notion of timber harvest -
ing often conjures images of profit-driven logging companies decimating pristine forests, land 
management agencies can use harvests to improve wildlife habitat and reduce fire risk.26 In fact, 
almost half of the contested timber harvesting projects in this dataset were also part of a fuel 
management project. This finding underscores one of the most concerning challenges imposed 
on land management agencies by NEPA: obstruction of wildfire mitigation efforts.
Table 7: Types of forest management appeals, 20132022.
Type Number of cases% of total forest  
management cases
Timber harvest 26 38.8%
Fuel management 26 38.8%
Roadsvehicle use 10 14.9%
Salvage logging 5 7.5%
Grazing 4 6.0%
Note: Forest management cases are multifaceted and thus cannot be categorized by a single variable. This table shows the num -
ber of cases that address various types, but each category is not mutually exclusive, so percentages total more than 100%. 
Scientists and forest managers have made clear  that fuel reduction is the most effective way to 
decrease wildfire risk.27 As the wildfire crisis has escalated in the United States, the need for fuel 
reduction has only grown. Unfortunately, the Forest Service spends 3.6 to 4.7 years  on paperwork 
before a fuel management project can start.28 NEPA allows plaintiffs to stall projects even further 
with litigation, which can add over a year to the process.29 In this dataset, an average of three 
years elapsed between an agencys issuing a permit for a fuel reduction project and the end of 
litigation. Notably though, agencies won 93% of cases related to fuel reduction projects, 96% of 
which were brought by NGOs.
NEPA litigation added 3.9 years on average to energy project development.
In this dataset, 29% of total NEPA appeals cases contested energy projects. The distribution of 
contested projects shows a balance among challenges to projects involving fossil fuel infrastruc -
ture (37%), clean energy production (33%), and fossil fuel extraction (22%) (Table 8). This balance 
challenges the common narrative that only certain types of projects face legal opposition. 
 ---------- NEW PAGE ---------- 
12
Instead, it underscores the reality that legal challenges are an inherent aspect of energy  
development, regardless of the energy source involved. At the same time, different technologies 
trigger NEPA compliance reviews at different rates. For example, under 10% of utility-scale  
solar projects  built since 2010 underwent the NEPA environmental impact statement process 
(because most solar projects are on state or private rather than federal land), compared to 100% 
of offshore wind projects.30 The true burden of litigation relates to the rate at which projects  
are reviewed and then contested, which was not measured in our study.
Instead, these findings highlight the impact of NEPA litigation on energy project outcomes. 
Litigation delayed project implementation by 3.9 years on average, despite the fact that agencies 
won 71% of these challenges. NGOs filed 74% of energy cases, with just 10 organizations respon -
sible for 48% of these challenges. 
Plaintiffs rarely won cases against fossil fuel infrastructure projects (26% success rate) or clean 
energy production projects (24%). However, challengers won cases against fossil fuel extraction 
projects at a notably higher rate (40%). The distinction can be explained in part by the kinds of 
groups challenging projects.

Fossil fuel extraction projects were mostly contested by large, national NGOs. Thats because 
the cases largely focused on oil and gas leases, which are concentrated on public land with 
few directly impacted stakeholders. Typically, only organizations with the capacity to monitor 
and understand the legal complexities of the fossil fuel extraction process can pursue such 
challenges, inherently limiting the number of viable plaintiffs. Plaintiffs didnt win fossil 
fuel extraction cases at a higher rate because of such expertise, though. The five groups most 
involved in these cases (Table 9) had a 28% win-rate across categories, not particularly higher 
than the average win-rate for all categories. Rather, extraction cases may be easier for challengers 
to win, though further research is needed to confirm such dynamics.
By contrast, fossil fuel infrastructure projects and clean energy production projects were chal -
lenged by a combination of national and regional NGOs and were won by them at a similar rate. 
Oil and gas pipelines run through communities in multiple states, which increases visibility 
and the number of impacted stakeholders that can file challenges. The Sierra Club, for example, 
partnered with Delaware Riverkeeper Network, Wild Virginia, and Appalachian Voices to file chal -
lenges to pipelines in each organizations territory. Clean energy projects are similarly localized, 
drawing challenges from a wide variety of national and regional organizations. While national 
NGOs were involved in the greatest share of cases, they accounted for a smaller share (8%) than 
in the case of fossil fuels.

CONCLUSION
Overall, this analysis sheds light on the need to reform judicial review procedures under NEPA. 
Currently, litigation rarely produces substantial changes to environmental outcomes, instead 
creating a platform for a narrow set of well-resourced NGOs to further their missions. This status 
quo not only drains agency resources for challenges that are seldom successful, but pulls 
resources from services that actually improve environmental outcomes, like forest management. 
As Congress debates reform, its essential for policymakers to prioritize pragmatic solutions that 
streamline the NEPA review process and empower agencies to fulfill their obligations efficiently.
