CONCLUSION
Overall, this analysis sheds light on the need to reform judicial review procedures under NEPA. 
Currently, litigation rarely produces substantial changes to environmental outcomes, instead 
creating a platform for a narrow set of well-resourced NGOs to further their missions. This status 
quo not only drains agency resources for challenges that are seldom successful, but pulls 
resources from services that actually improve environmental outcomes, like forest management. 
As Congress debates reform, its essential for policymakers to prioritize pragmatic solutions that 
streamline the NEPA review process and empower agencies to fulfill their obligations efficiently.
