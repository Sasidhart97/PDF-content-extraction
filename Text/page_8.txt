Even the most well-resourced NGOs rarely won cases when challenging NEPA decisions.  
Just 10 NGOs initiated 35% of the total challenges (Table 4), and they had a success rate of just 
26%, merely 6% higher than the average success rate for all types of plaintiffs. Thats less  
than in prior decades , when prominent environmental groups won 35% of their appeals.16
Yet, these organizations pride themselves on being experts in environmental litigation.  
The Sierra Club advertises itself as having perfected the art of campaign litigation and  
lawyer-organizing.17 The Center for Biological Diversity claims that it melds  cutting-edge  
legal strategies with grassroots organizing .18 The Natural Resources Defense Council helped 
start the environmental legal movement  and maintains significant litigation activities today.19 
These and other groups make clear that their NEPA litigation is not solely utilized to improve 
environmental outcomes associated with infrastructure projects, but to obstruct and delay proj -
ects themselves, often for the purpose of preventing the project from ever moving forward at all.

Energy and infrastructure projects in particular are more likely to face cancellation if challenged 
under NEPA .20 While project cancellation is not the intent of the statute, litigation represents a 
creative and effective strategy to stop projects plaintiffs believe will do substantial harm. But 
these groups frequently contest projects that serve national policy objectives set by elected offi -
cials, calling the purpose and societal benefit of judicial review in its current form into question.
