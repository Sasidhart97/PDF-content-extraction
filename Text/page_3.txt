Key findings:  
  Between 2013 and 2022, circuit courts heard approximately 39 NEPA appeals cases per year,  
a 56% increase over the rate from 2001 to 2015 .2
  Agencies won about 80% of the 2013-2022 appeals cases, 11% more per year than from 2001 
to 2004 , 8% more than from 2001 to 2008 , and 4% less than from 2009 to 2015 .3 The rate at 
which agencies reviews are upheld is high, meaning these environmental reviews are seldom 
changed as a result of litigation.
  On average, 4.2 years elapsed between publication of an environmental impact statement  
or environmental assessment and conclusion of the corresponding legal challenge at the 
appellate level. Of these appealed cases, 84% were closed less than six years after the contested 
permit was published, and 39% were closed in less than three.
  Among the challenges, 42% contested environmental impact statements, and 36% contested 
environmental assessments. Agencies won about 80% of challenges to both.
  NGOs instigated 72% of the total challenges. Of those, just 10 organizations initiated 35% and 
had a success rate of just 26%, merely 6% higher than the average for all types of plaintiffs.
  Only 2.8% of NEPA litigations pertained to agency assessment of environmental justice issues.
  Public lands management projects were the most common subject of litigation (37%), the 
greatest share of which (47%) challenged forest management projects. Just 10 groups filed 67% 
of the challenges to forest management projects and collectively won only 23% of those cases, 
adding 3.7 years on average to the process of implementing the 77% of projects on cases  
they lost.
  Energy projects were the second most common subject of litigation (29%). Litigation delayed 
fossil fuel and clean energy project implementation by 3.9 years on average, despite the fact 
that agencies won 71% of those challenges. NGOs filed 74% of energy cases, with just 10 organi -
zations responsible for 48% of challenges.
