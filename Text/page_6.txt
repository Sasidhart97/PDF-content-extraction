Note:  This table includes data only from the 258 cases contesting EAs and EISs, as data on CEs and other reviews is rarely 
accessible. Some Records of Decision and Findings of No Significant Impact provided only the month and year of publication; 
we coded those cases using the first day of the given month.
Thus, the window for eligible challenges to environmental review could be shortened substan -
tially without meaningfully affecting environmental outcomes.   
Agencies fulfilled their responsibilities under NEPA with exceptional accuracy, regardless of  
the level of review required.
Table 2: Appeals and agency win-rates for all NEPA reviews by document type and total, 20132022.
Document type Number of cases % of total cases Agency win-rate
Categorical exclusion 19 4.9% 73.7%
Environmental assessment 139 35.8% 79.1%
Environmental impact statement 162 41.8% 79.6%
NA 67 17.5% 82.1%
Total 387 79.6%
Note:  NA refers to cases in which a NEPA review was not conducted, but plaintiffs argue one should be.
Overall, while there were slight differences in win-rates across document types, agencies prevailed 
in about 80% of challenges filed against both EAs and EISs (Table 2). This finding is remarkable 
because both the substance of and arguments brought against the two documents differ substan -
tially across agencies and project types.
