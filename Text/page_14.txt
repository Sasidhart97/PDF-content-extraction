Fossil fuel extraction projects were mostly contested by large, national NGOs. Thats because 
the cases largely focused on oil and gas leases, which are concentrated on public land with 
few directly impacted stakeholders. Typically, only organizations with the capacity to monitor 
and understand the legal complexities of the fossil fuel extraction process can pursue such 
challenges, inherently limiting the number of viable plaintiffs. Plaintiffs didnt win fossil 
fuel extraction cases at a higher rate because of such expertise, though. The five groups most 
involved in these cases (Table 9) had a 28% win-rate across categories, not particularly higher 
than the average win-rate for all categories. Rather, extraction cases may be easier for challengers 
to win, though further research is needed to confirm such dynamics.
By contrast, fossil fuel infrastructure projects and clean energy production projects were chal -
lenged by a combination of national and regional NGOs and were won by them at a similar rate. 
Oil and gas pipelines run through communities in multiple states, which increases visibility 
and the number of impacted stakeholders that can file challenges. The Sierra Club, for example, 
partnered with Delaware Riverkeeper Network, Wild Virginia, and Appalachian Voices to file chal -
lenges to pipelines in each organizations territory. Clean energy projects are similarly localized, 
drawing challenges from a wide variety of national and regional organizations. While national 
NGOs were involved in the greatest share of cases, they accounted for a smaller share (8%) than 
in the case of fossil fuels.
