An EA assesses if a proposed project will impact the environment. An EIS is generally conducted 
once an EA has determined a project will impact the environment and evaluates how to min -
imize that impact. By virtue of their complexity, EISs create more opportunities for litigation. 
While challengers often argue that agencies erred in not elevating an EA to an EIS, theyre able 
to argue that an EIS did not consider any number of alternative actions. Still, agencies prevail 
in challenges to both EISs and EAs at the same rate, suggesting agency decision-making rarely 
needs oversight when it comes to NEPA compliance. 
Major national environmental NGOs instigated a disproportionate share of this litigation.
Consistent with trends observed in the previous decade , NGOs in 2013-2022 accounted for a 
sizable majority of NEPA-related appeals (72%), with state and local governments, individuals, 
companies, and other stakeholders filing far lower shares of appealed cases (Table 3).13 However, 
these nonprofit organizations lost appeals in 2013-2022 at a marginally higher rate than in  
previous periods, with a 13% increase in losses compared to 2001 to 2005  and a 5% increase  
compared to 2001 to 2015.14
Despite their expertise and concentrated staff capacity, NGOs werent substantially more success -
ful than other plaintiffs in their appeals. Plaintiffs won 16% of cases that did not involve NGOs, 
a 7% lower success rate than those that did. This finding diverges from an earlier analysis  that 
found environmental plaintiffs prevailed between 17% and 13% more often than other groups 
in Circuit Courts.15
