Instead, it underscores the reality that legal challenges are an inherent aspect of energy  
development, regardless of the energy source involved. At the same time, different technologies 
trigger NEPA compliance reviews at different rates. For example, under 10% of utility-scale  
solar projects  built since 2010 underwent the NEPA environmental impact statement process 
(because most solar projects are on state or private rather than federal land), compared to 100% 
of offshore wind projects.30 The true burden of litigation relates to the rate at which projects  
are reviewed and then contested, which was not measured in our study.
Instead, these findings highlight the impact of NEPA litigation on energy project outcomes. 
Litigation delayed project implementation by 3.9 years on average, despite the fact that agencies 
won 71% of these challenges. NGOs filed 74% of energy cases, with just 10 organizations respon -
sible for 48% of these challenges. 
Plaintiffs rarely won cases against fossil fuel infrastructure projects (26% success rate) or clean 
energy production projects (24%). However, challengers won cases against fossil fuel extraction 
projects at a notably higher rate (40%). The distinction can be explained in part by the kinds of 
groups challenging projects.
